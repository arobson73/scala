//Note if i want ammonite REPL to display characters like this 
"The quick brown 狐 jumped over the lazy 犬"

then:
replace the 'repl.pprinter()and add in a handler forString` that prints things with less/no escaping
you want a new additionalHandlers
go jump around the signatures and you should be able to figure out how to do it
repl.pprinter() = repl.pprinter().copy(additionalHandlers = ...)
